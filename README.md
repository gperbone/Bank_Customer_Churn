# Customer Churning Prediction

<img src="https://feradasfinancas.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2283451-scaled.jpg" >

## Background
A bank realizes their clients have been churning and wants to try to figure out, based on past data, which clients are more likely to churn in the future, so it gets to act before losing them.

## Overiew
In this project, I took a Kaggle dataset to explore the features available and predict which clients from a bank would churn, using Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost models.
I also compare my top performing models and discuss in which scenarios I would suggest each one.

## Dataset source
The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers).

## Feedback
Do you have any feedback on how I could improve this project? I would love to hear it, and you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavoperbone/)
